Build the ArtOverwatch iOS App Exclusively in SwiftUI — Following Apple’s Best Practices & Modern Architecture
✅ Objective
Design and implement the ArtOverwatch iOS application using SwiftUI exclusively — no UIKit components, no Storyboards, no programmatic UIViews. The app must embody Apple’s human interface guidelines, leverage modern Swift concurrency, and follow a modular, testable, scalable architecture inspired by Elm + Composition Root, as validated by industry-leading iOS development practices.

This is not a prototype. This is a production-grade, enterprise-ready creative platform that treats artists as CEOs of their own intellectual property businesses.

🏗️ App Overview
Name: ArtOverwatch
Tagline: “Full control. Full vision.”
Mission:
A unified, corporate-grade iOS platform empowering visual artists to own and manage their entire creative enterprise — from idea incubation to IP protection, revenue tracking, branding, treasury management, and community ownership — all within a single, beautifully crafted, secure, and intuitive experience. Eliminate fragmented tools; replace them with an elegant, cohesive system that scales with the artist’s ambition.
⚙️ Core Technical Requirements
1. Technology Stack — SwiftUI Only
UI Framework: SwiftUI exclusively — zero UIKit (UIView, UIViewController, UITableView, etc.) permitted.
State Management & Architecture:
Implement a modular Elm-inspired architecture with two layers:
Scene-Level (Elm Pattern):
Each feature module follows:
State → Event → Effect → Reducer → View
State: Immutable struct (single source of truth)
Event: Enum of user/system actions (e.g., .userTappedRegisterIP)
Effect: Enum of side effects (e.g., .apiCallFetchIPStatus) — separate from Events!
Reducer: Pure functions (transform and apply) — no side effects inside views
Environment: Dependency injection container (API, storage, auth services)
View: Pure function of State — no business logic
App-Level (Composition Root):
Use Swift Package Manager (SPM) to modularize the codebase into isolated packages:

✅ Each feature package must be independently compilable, testable, and importable.
✅ No global state. No singletons. All dependencies injected via Environment. 

2. Concurrency — Async/Await Only
Use Swift Concurrency (async/await) for all network calls, file I/O, and background operations.
Replace Combine with async/await where possible — prefer simplicity over reactive complexity.
If Combine is used (e.g., for system events), wrap it cleanly in async interfaces.
Never use GCD directly unless absolutely necessary (e.g., low-level threading).
3. Persistence — SwiftData or Core Data
Prefer SwiftData (iOS 17+) for SwiftUI-native modeling.
If targeting iOS 16, use Core Data with @FetchRequest and NSManagedObject.
All data models must conform to Identifiable, Codable, and Equatable.
4. Networking — URLSession Only
Use URLSession with async/await and structured concurrency.
No third-party libraries (Alamofire, Moya, etc.).
Wrap API calls in protocol-based services injected via Environment.
5. Testing — Mandatory
Unit Tests: Test reducers with mock environments. Validate state transitions on every event/effect combination.
Snapshot Tests: Capture UI states using XCTest screenshot capture or SnapshotTesting framework — ensure UI consistency across modes and devices.
Test Coverage Goal: >85% for core business logic (reducers, models, services).
🖌️ Human Interface Guidelines Compliance — Apple HIG (Mandatory)
Every screen must adhere to Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines. Do not guess — reference these links directly.

🧠 Architecture Philosophy — Based on Modern iOS Best Practices
✅ Adopt the Elm Architecture + Composition Root
(Source: Modern Architecture for iOS Apps — https://medium.com/@antony.karpov/modern-architecture-for-ios-apps-7a791439f9e3 )

Single Source of Truth: State is immutable. Changed only via pure Reducer functions.
Unidirectional Flow:
User Action → Event → Reducer (with Environment) → New State → View Rebuild
Event/Effect Separation:
Event: Public, user-initiated actions (case userDidTapSave)
Effect: Private, internal side effects (case apiCallSucceeded)
→ Prevents external tampering with internal logic.
Pure Functions Everywhere:
transform(event: Event, state: State, environment: Environment) async -> Effect
apply(effect: Effect, state: inout State) async -> State
→ Enables 100% testability without mocks.
Dependency Injection via Environment:
swift


1
2
3
4
5
struct AppEnvironment {
    let ipService: IPServiceProtocol
    let authService: AuthServiceProtocol
    let storage: StorageProtocol
}
Modularity via SPM:
Each feature = separate Swift Package.
→ Enables parallel team development, faster builds, clear boundaries.
✅ Avoid These Anti-Patterns
❌ Massive ViewControllers
❌ Global state / singletons
❌ Business logic inside views
❌ Hardcoded colors/fonts/sizes
❌ Third-party frameworks (RxSwift, Alamofire, Kingfisher, etc.)
❌ UIKit components under any circumstance
❌ Storyboards or XIBs
❌ Combine unless absolutely necessary (prefer async/await)
❌ Using deprecated patterns like VIPER or RIBs with SwiftUI
📦 Asset & Branding Requirements
App Icon: Follow App Icons HIG — adaptive mask, no transparency artifacts, all required sizes.
SF Symbols: Use for all UI icons. Customize weight/variant. Never bundle PNG icons except for the logo.
Color Palette: Define brand colors as Color extensions using UIColor.systemBlue as base. Ensure WCAG AA contrast.
Typography: Use San Francisco (SF Pro). Use semantic styles: .headline, .callout, .footnote.
Images: Use .resizable(), .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit). Optimize assets in Assets Catalog.
Localization: Support English (en-US) initially. Structure strings for easy future expansion.
🚀 Advanced Features (Stretch Goals)
Onboarding Flow: Guided setup using FullScreenCover with step-by-step explanations (follow HIG Onboarding — https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/onboarding ).
Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Respect system setting, allow override in Settings (persist via UserDefaults wrapped in service).
Notifications: Register for remote/local notifications (e.g., royalty updates, IP registration confirmations) using UserNotifications.
Share Extension: Allow users to share artwork metadata or IP certificates via ShareSheet.
Widget: Create a Home Screen widget showing daily revenue summary or upcoming IP deadlines (use WidgetKit).
Sign in with Apple: Primary authentication method (follow HIG Sign In with Apple — https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sign-in-with-apple ).

🚫 DO NOT DO
❌ Use UIKit components (UIView, UIViewController, UITableView, UILabel, etc.)
❌ Use third-party frameworks (RxSwift, Alamofire, Kingfisher, etc.)
❌ Hardcode colors, fonts, or sizes
❌ Use global state or singletons for business logic
❌ Ignore accessibility or dynamic type
❌ Use Storyboards or XIBs
❌ Use Combine unless absolutely necessary (prefer async/await)
❌ Use @StateObject for non-view-model objects
