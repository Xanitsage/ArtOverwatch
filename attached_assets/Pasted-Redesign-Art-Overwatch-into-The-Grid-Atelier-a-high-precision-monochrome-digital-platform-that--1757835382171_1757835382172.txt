Redesign Art Overwatch into “The Grid Atelier” — a high-precision, monochrome digital platform that empowers artists to collaborate, create, and govern their collective as a transparent, equity-based organization.

Core Functionality (From Diagram):

Artists are members of a shared entity (“The Grid Atelier”)
Revenue from commercial work flows through a Treasury, split among members based on contribution
A Label may invest ($100k) in exchange for 10% ownership and access to IP
The entity owns IP, brand, and business operations
It pays insurance and receives non-profit funding
All financial splits are transparent and traceable
Design Vision:

Transform the app into a minimalist, quadratic, black-and-white interface inspired by architectural blueprints and corporate governance diagrams — clean, precise, and deeply intentional.
Use only sharp angles, straight lines, and grid-aligned elements — no curves, no soft shadows, no rounded corners. Everything snaps to an 8px baseline grid.
Replace all icons with custom-designed quadratic symbols that reflect function:
🔄 → "Splits" = a square with two arrows forming a loop
💼 → "Treasury" = a box with a coin inside
👥 → "Members" = stacked squares with smiley faces
🏦 → "Label" = a bank icon made of rectangles
🔐 → "IP Ownership" = a lock formed by intersecting lines
Rebrand “Artist Corp” to “The Grid Atelier” — a name that evokes precision, creativity, and collective ownership. Update all UI text accordingly.
UI System & Components (shadcn/ui + Quadratic Override):

Build on shadcn/ui but enforce:
border-radius: 0 on all components
Monochrome palette: #FFFFFF, #111111, #333333, #666666 only
Typography: SF Pro Text or Inter, sizes: 14pt (body), 16pt (labels), 18pt (titles)
Spacing: multiples of 8px; margins/padding: 8, 16, 24, 32
Interactive states: hover = white border; active = white fill; focus = dashed outline
Use glassmorphism subtly: only on modals and cards with backdrop-filter: blur(4px) and background: rgba(255,255,255,0.05)
App Structure (Based on Diagram & Reference Screens):

Dashboard (Home)
Modular layout of key metrics:
📊 “Revenue Splits” → bar chart (quadratic bars, white lines)
💸 “Treasury Balance” → circular progress ring (replaced with square ring)
👥 “Active Members” → grid of avatars (square, 48x48px)
🏦 “Label Investment” → card showing $100k investment, 10% ownership
🔐 “IP Status” → toggle: “Owned by Atelier”
Bottom nav: Home, Canvas, Splits, Profile
Canvas View
Full-screen art workspace with grid overlay (subtle 16px lines)
Layered brush strokes rendered as thin white lines
Peer annotations appear as floating rectangular labels with user avatar (square) and timestamp
Toolbar: tools aligned horizontally, each a square button with a quadratic icon
Splits Hub
Timeline view of revenue distribution
Each transaction is a horizontal rectangle with:
Source (e.g., “Commercial Revenue”)
Amount
Split percentages (e.g., RENE: 25%, YUKI: 30%)
Destination (e.g., “Treasury”, “Non-Profit Funding”)
Visualize splits with stacked horizontal bars (like the diagram)
Click to see full breakdown per member
Profile & Governance
Member profile: name, role, ownership %, contributions
Voting history: list of proposals with yes/no votes (white check/X)
Treasury dashboard: incoming/outgoing funds, audit trail
Label agreement: view investment terms, ownership %, rights
Interaction Design (Apple HIG Compliant):

Direct manipulation: drag sliders, tap to expand, swipe to navigate
Micro-interactions:
Cards slide in from bottom (axis-aligned)
Buttons scale slightly on tap (0.95 → 1.05)
Progress rings animate clockwise in discrete steps
Feedback appears with fade-in + upward shift (but only on axis)
Accessibility: VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, contrast ≥ 4.5:1
Visual Language (From References + Diagram):

Retain the modular card layout, progress indicators, and data visualization from the smart-home references
But replace color with form and structure: use white-on-black with thin borders, dashed outlines, and grid alignment to convey hierarchy and state
Use flow lines (like in the diagram) to connect related elements — e.g., from “Label” to “Splits” with a thin line
Make the entire interface feel like a living organizational chart — every element has a purpose, every connection is visible
Deliverables:

Figma prototype with all screens: Dashboard, Canvas, Splits, Profile, Login
Custom quadratic icon set (SVGs)
shadcn/ui component library with overrides for quadratic style
Interactive flows showing:
Revenue split breakdown
Membership voting
Label investment view
Canvas collaboration
Documentation of naming, spacing, typography, and iconography standards
The final product should feel like a digital constitution for artists — not just a tool, but a governing interface where creativity meets equity. It should look like it was built by a design team at NASA, Apple, and MoMA — cold, precise, beautiful, and deeply human. 

🔍 Why This Works
Business Logic
Now directly reflected in UI (e.g., "Splits", "Treasury", "Label")
Naming
“The Grid Atelier” ties visual style to concept
Icons
Designed to match the quadratic theme and functional clarity
Flow
Mirrors the diagram’s structure in app navigation
Visuals
Uses reference layouts but transforms them into monochrome, geometric forms
Depth
Combines
smart-home UI elegance
with
corporate governance clarity
